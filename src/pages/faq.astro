  {
    q: "How do bookings work?",
    a: "Contact me via the form, email, or WhatsApp with your dates and interests. We'll have a quick chat to discuss your preferences, and I'll create a custom itinerary. Once you're happy, I'll send a booking confirmation and payment details."
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in the price?",
    a: "All packages include premium transport, my personal guide services, entrance fees to venues, and professional photography. Food and accommodation can be included or arranged separately based on your preferences."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I customize the experiences?",
    a: "Absolutely! Every tour is bespoke. The packages are starting points—we'll tailor everything to your interests, pace, and style."
  },
  {
    q: "How far in advance should I book?",
    a: "I recommend 2-4 weeks for the best availability, especially during peak season (November-March). However, I've accommodated last-minute bookings when possible."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you accommodate dietary restrictions?",
    a: "Yes! Just let me know any dietary requirements, allergies, or preferences. South Africa has excellent options for all dietary needs."
  },
  {
    q: "What about safety and insurance?",
    a: "Your safety is my top priority. I'm fully insured, use reputable transport services, and know Cape Town intimately. I'll keep you informed about any safety considerations."
  },
  {
    q: "Can you help with accommodation?",
    a: "Yes! I can recommend and arrange everything from luxury hotels to boutique guesthouses, based on your budget and preferences."
  },
  {
    q: "What if the weather doesn't cooperate?",
    a: "Cape Town weather can be unpredictable. I always have backup plans, and we'll adjust the itinerary as needed. Some of my best tours happened on 'off' weather days!"
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer multi-day packages?",
    a: "Yes! Multi-day experiences are my favorite. We can explore beyond Cape Town—Garden Route, safari, coastal towns, whatever interests you."
  },
  {
    q: "What's your cancellation policy?",
    a: "Full refund if cancelled 7+ days before. 50% refund for 3-7 days notice. Within 3 days, we can reschedule if possible. Life happens—I'm flexible."
  },
  {
    q: "How many people per tour?",
    a: "I specialize in intimate experiences: 1-4 guests is ideal. For larger groups, we can discuss options."
  },
  {
    q: "Do you speak other languages?",
    a: "I speak English fluently and some Afrikaans. For other languages, I can arrange professional translation services."
